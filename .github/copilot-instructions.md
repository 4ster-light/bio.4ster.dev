This project uses **Deno exclusively** for all development, build, and deployment tasks.

## **Available Commands**

# Git and GitHub

This project uses Git for version control and is hosted on GitHub.

When told to deploy, besides running `deno task deploy`, also make sure first all changes are
committed with an appropiate message and pushed to the main branch.

## **Notes**

- Use meaningful commit messages for better project history.
- Ensure code is linted and formatted before committing changes.
